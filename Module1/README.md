# Module 1: Machine Learning Basics (Detailed Notes)

## 1.1 Artificial Intelligence vs Machine Learning vs Deep Learning

**Artificial Intelligence (AI):**  
A broad area of computer science focused on creating systems that can perform tasks typically requiring human intelligence. Examples include problem-solving, language understanding, and decision-making.

**Machine Learning (ML):**  
A subset of AI where systems learn from data to improve performance on tasks. Rather than being explicitly programmed, the system uses patterns in data to make predictions or decisions.

**Deep Learning (DL):**  
A further subset of ML that uses neural networks with multiple layers (deep networks). DL is especially powerful for image recognition, natural language processing, and speech recognition.

## 1.2 Types of Machine Learning

**Supervised Learning:**  
Uses labeled data. The algorithm learns from input-output pairs. Examples: spam detection, loan approval.

**Unsupervised Learning:**  
Uses unlabeled data. The system identifies hidden patterns or structures in the data. Examples: customer segmentation, topic modeling.

**Reinforcement Learning:**  
The system learns by interacting with an environment and receiving feedback in the form of rewards or penalties. Example: training game-playing agents.

## 1.3 Supervised Learning & its Types

Supervised learning algorithms map input to output based on example input-output pairs.

**Types:**
- **Classification:** Output is a category.  
  _Example:_ Classifying emails as spam or not spam.
- **Regression:** Output is a continuous value.  
  _Example:_ Predicting house prices based on size and location.

## 1.4 Unsupervised Learning & its Types

Unsupervised learning finds hidden structure in data.

**Types:**
- **Clustering:**  
  Group data points based on similarity.  
  _Example:_ Grouping customers by buying behavior.

- **Association:**  
  Discover rules that describe large portions of the data.  
  _Example:_ "Customers who buy X also buy Y."

## 1.5 Deep Learning â€“ Basics

Deep Learning models are inspired by the human brain. They are composed of layers of artificial neurons.

**Core Concepts:**
- **Neurons & Layers:**  
  Neurons process inputs and pass them to the next layer.
- **Activation Functions:**  
  Functions like ReLU, sigmoid, etc., decide whether a neuron should fire.
- **Backpropagation:**  
  The process of adjusting weights using gradients to reduce errors.

Deep learning is used in applications like:
- Self-driving cars
- Face recognition
- Machine translation
